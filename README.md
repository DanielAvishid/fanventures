# FanVentures - Landing Page

This project is a web application built with a Node.js and Express backend and a React frontend. It includes an API for adding a letter of intent and an API for sending emails via Gmail.

## About

I worked as a full-stack developer at FanVentures, where this project was 100% my responsibility. As the solo developer, I created the entire application using Node.js, Express.js, and React.js to receive letters of intent and automate email responses to user questions. Additionally, I handled the deployment and hosting of the application with a VPS provider.

## Features

- **Node.js and Express Backend**: Handles API requests.
- **React Frontend**: Provides a user interface for interacting with the application.
- **Add Letter of Intent API**: Allows users to submit a letter of intent.
- **Send Email API**: Sends emails via Gmail.
